2) 9 I used the command git rev-list --all --count

3) Last modified Thu Oct 23 18:25:26 2025 used the command git log README.md

4) To allow multiple people to work on different parts without interfering and to safely 
test or develop features. 

5) git status is meant to display the current sate of your working directory and 
the index and git log is meant to display the history of committed changes in your repository.

6) git log Vehicle.h

7) git log --grep="file"

8) (I) Inheritance is a feature that allows a class to acquire fields and methods of another class.
   (II) Polymorphism means the ability of different objects to respond to the same function or method call in different ways.
   (III) Encapsulation means the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit.

9) The integration manager workflow uses a centralized integration process, where each developer
maintains both a public and private repository. Developers push their work to their own public 
repositories and the integration manager is responsible for merging changes into the main repository.

The dictator and lieutenants workflow is different as it is more distributed, it still has one central
repository but only the dictator can push to it. The dictator merges the contributions from several 
lieutenants each who manages their own subset of developers. 

10) They can benefit as it scales collaboration efficiently by distributing responsibility. Instead of all 
100 developers pushing and pulling from a single repository as it would be with the centralized workflow, smaller
groups of developers push their work to their assigned lieutenant. Then each lieutenant manages integration for their group,
this way reducing conflicts and improving organization.
